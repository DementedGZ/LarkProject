You and the rest of your crew [CODENAME: SUSNIX] have been stranded in the middle of space, 
left with only your wits and indefatigable purpose.
Work with them to complete specific tasks and repair your ship.

[ACCESS CODE: Stw3rkUS]
[ACCESS CODE ACCEPTED]
Welcome, Captain [RED]. This information is for your eyes only, as to keep the rest of
[SUSNIX] in a state of calm.
The destruction of the ship's functions seems to have been done by hand.
...a suspicious individual may have hopped on board, sowing destruction
and hoping for the fall of the entire crew in their wake...
Find them, and eliminate them, lest the ship and all of [SUSNIX] fall with you.
